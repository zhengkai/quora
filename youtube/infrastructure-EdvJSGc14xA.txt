00:13
everybody's talking at me
00:17
I don't care what saying
00:20
only their goals of my
00:25
[Music]
00:31
pious Thomas rush hour at Penn Station
00:35
New York's busiest and at least aesthetically appealing railway Center
00:38
and trains I take pass through here
00:40
along the trains of half a million
00:42
others everyday which is connected to
00:45
New York and rest of the Northeast by
00:46
one little tunnel built in 1910 and
00:50
drastic need of repair

just like the
00:53
rest of America
structure one Amtrak's North River tunnel has two
01:00
tracks the only rail lines under the
01:02
Hudson connecting New York City to the
01:03
rest of the country
this bottleneck
01:05
that's even worse at winter when ice
01:07
forms in cracks left by Hurricane sandy
01:08
and

100 years of general wear and tear
01:11
forcing Amtrak to periodically shut down
01:13
the tunnels and defrost their catenary
01:14
electrical lines
01:18

when as you look around a wire usually
01:21
this bicycles which we say if we stop
01:23
them do not get that
01:30
this icicle here could trip out the
01:32
catenary to knock the wire down and
01:35
train to come in then you have 600
01:37
people here straighter and you got no
01:38
power people freeze it on a trade route
01:40
we keep up with the ice so what would
01:42
happen if we don't it'll happen a lot
01:57
what happens call the PD right now hey
02:02
did you lose the South tube now okay
02:04
we're almost done in here blot ice ice
02:09
scraping and other emergency maintenance
02:10
keeps the North River tunnel in service
02:12
at least for now

but it's a band-aid
solution to the complete overhaul the
tunnel needs to make it through its
second century intact

this thing needs
02:19
to be rebuilt essentially from the
02:21
inside out

so the idea here is to build
a new tunnel shift all the traffic into
the new tunnel

so that we can then come
02:27
back and rebuild these

so that would all
set down you have four tracks under the
Hudson

a four track Hudson rail line is
02:33
one of the goals of the Gateway program
02:35
while the new tunnel is still waiting
02:36
for full funding

the old one puts as
much as 20% of the entire country's GDP
in jeopardy

every time it has to be
closed which is frequently

chaos and confusion at Penn Station last night
02:47
brands and problems at Penn Station
02:49
again

the North River tunnel needs federal money to help cover its estimated thirteen billion dollar price tag

a number that goes up by over 1 million dollars every day they put off digging

fortunately the guy we elected president made a big deal out of allocating big money to big infrastructure projects just like this one

we need to pass a 1 trillion dollar infrastructure plan

to build new roads
03:11
and bridges and airports and tunnels and
03:13
highways and railways

all across our
03:16
great nation

turning that big promise into an actual plan
was delegated to businessman and former member of the us-china congressional Commission Dan slain

slain produced a list of 50
infrastructure projects for the Trump
transition team to consider

prioritized
by their urgency and national importance

03:31
my plan was to search out the most
critical projects that we could start
with

then define how many jobs would be created by those

what the economic development benefit was

so that I could go up to Congress give them the estimates

and then the following year go back and give them the actual numbers

03:50
that was the plan

why did the approach you for infrastructure plan

because I knew a lot about China

I study what China did when their economy would start to dip

they switched over to structured

they started building
railroads hospitals power stations all
04:06
over Eastern China

billions of dollars that they poured into their country

and then when the economy picked up again

04:13
they stopped and

I saw the power of of infrastructure

our economy for the last ten years has been stagnating

there's
04:21
only two ways to grow your economy

you increase employment or your increased productivity, infrastructure does both

unlike China however the United States hasn't tapped into the full economy saving power of infrastructure since the middle of the last century

both in terms of building new stuff and keeping the old stuff in working order

and it shows
04:41
now we just suspected this bridge last year

there you can see the extent of the deterioration

see the hole
that's the call to floor beam at actually is a fracture critical member

fracture critical means and if one member fails the bridge can fail
okay
there's a hole on these you know very much ever floor beam all the way through

here's the dates on these nuts just when they were noticed or

that's how we keep track of it every time when we come back the next time
we look at that writing and decide whether or not
that hole has actually grown or not

and it has this bridge undergone any like nature innovations

this thing was built nineteen forty

something
05:14

everything is done this bridge from now
on will be a band-aid

it's a nice kind of like throwing money into a car yeah
exactly
05:20

throwing money into a twenty year old car

the National Bridge inventory has a zero to nine scale

and this bridge is rated to four which puts it in deficient category

we will close it when it gets lower than a three

05:33
they were to lower the weight limit or close the bridge where would be the nearest crossing

it's the only one but then a hundred miles or so either direction

how much time would that add to a trip

I'm guessing probably four hours to their time

multiply those four hours by just the six trucks we've seen crossing the bridge in the 20 minutes we've been here

and you've already got one full 24 hour day worth a lost time and wasted gas

then multiply that by the rest of the trucks on this route every day

and multiply that by the number of bridges and similar shapes statewide

and finally multiply all that by 50 states and 365 days a year

and you see how the American trucking industry claims to lose some 60 billion dollars annually just allows the infrastructure

but a big old chunk of American shipping is still done by exactly that

shipping

though its initial engineering was done by Mother Nature

the man-made infrastructure on our country's waterways this is old and dilapidated as it's terrestrial counterparts

the Army Corps of Engineers operates a network of locks and dams

that allow cargo boats barges and pleasure craft alike to navigate the country's rivers both upstream and downstream

from one elevation to another

this is Locks and Dam 52 on the Ohio River

this is America's single busiest lot

it's coming up on its 90th birthday

that's very old

and things do break and closures do happen

when they do with it costs our economy some billion dollars every year

I went to this jobs was kind of like waiting around on something to happen

I don't know some I was waiting

it's the army it's hurry up a way but the river dictates his job

we arrived at Locks and dam 52 smack in the middle of another closure

which by this point has become routine

a leak in the busiest lock and dam on the Ohio
07:06
River and

once again river traffic is at a halt at 52

now usually the water would be up to the top of the wicket when we get it all the way closed off

but last night we're trying to raise the dam all the way to the pier

we got a hold of a wicket and it came up sideways

we let go of it washed over a couple other wickets and went down river so we lost that one

07:24
so we're gonna regroup

we don't know exactly what shape it's in until we dive on it and pull them out

it's 1927 dams so

at any time we can have a catastrophic failure we're just gonna cost more money

it's a budget nightmare I'm sure kind of falling apart but the

whole point of locks and dams system is to prevent the river water from becoming too shallow for a boat to pass through

it while many of the 100-year old parts still work fine

like this vintage jazz era steam engine

the parts that don't can cause some serious headaches

not just for the lock tenders but for all the boats upriver

all those are those
07:59
tow boats

damn how we use them

a lot for several miles

as normal

yes not

once
08:06
bad traffic way it was
08:08
50 wait

I hope they've got some good books

closures the 52 have last as long as 18 days

and the consequent boat jams aren't just irritating they're also expensive

even having one boat wait here for 15 hours has been estimated to cost its company $80,000

we just have a lot of traffic here but this is busiest lock in the United States

it's busier than a Panama Canal

everything's coming through here

this is America's economy

log 52 is supposed to be replaced with the state of the art dam back in the 90s

but it's
still under construction

this is just one out of a whole network of locks and dams on one River

the Army Corps of Engineers estimates that it needs a minimum of five billion dollars worth of repairs

to keep the entire Inland Waterways system navigable over the next 20 years

and for corn farmers like Paul Jesse and the rest of our agricultural heartland slash breadbasket

there isn't really an alternative

these elevators are it's right in the best place

you can possibly beeps have the cheapest transportation for export

that is why we're so incredibly worried about the locks and dams going down

who absorbs the cost of that

that either has to be paid for by us getting a lower price for our grain

for paying more for the other inputs that we buy

the only source of that money in my opinion ultimately is Department

even when the waterways older infrastructure is working

the scale at wood shipping technology and output have grown in the last hundred years

this far outstripped some of its capabilities

boats pass through lock 21 with a tow boat pushing 150 foot barges

I'll do is break off nine from the 15

push those through

and then the boat will push the other six turn rejoin until the next lock

most of the United States locks and dams aren't big enough for a larger barge toes to pass through all together

so they have to be split up
09:51
and reassembled at every lock along
09:53
their route so now the bus and a lock
09:55
the deckhands are going to break apart
09:57
the two sections of barge I don't
10:00
guising how low-tech it is the guy on
10:02
top of the line it's called a mule
10:03
because that job used to be done by
10:05
mules no disrespect but I just felt like
10:08
they could give them a better title at
10:10
this point a slow going as the waterways
10:12
can get there still far and away the
10:13
most efficient and really the only
10:15
sustainable way of shipping cargo at
10:17
this scale if this were all to be
10:18
shipped by a train or trucks how many of
10:20
us take with a 15 barge tonne loaded at
10:23
nine foot it had to be 225 jumbo hopper
10:26
cars on a train it's 870 semi trucks
10:29
oh it's that'd be 11 and a half miles
10:30
bumper to bumper to move what's in these
10:33
barges that's crazy
10:34
once the barges make it through all the
10:36
locks and dams to the bottom of the
10:38
river they still have one more piece of
10:39
faulty infrastructure to contend with
10:41
before their goods can be shipped abroad
10:42
the port of South Louisiana also on
10:45
dance lands infrastructural fix-it list
10:47
[Music]
10:48
this is the major export port for the
10:51
United States when you think about 31
10:53
States most of them are shipping grain
10:55
and agriculture down here it was
10:57
unbelievable it's also pretty nice and
10:59
France to sell it to us for so cheap
11:00
right what's going on down here
11:04
the major problem here is the silting at
11:08
the mouth
11:09
a place called Southwest Bears and the
11:12
Corps doesn't have the resources to keep
11:15
it open to a level of 50 feet draught
11:18
that's the new ships coming through the
11:19
Panama Canal so 2016 they have to lower
11:22
the draft to 41 feet for every foot you
11:25
lower you lose a million dollars of
11:27
bargain when you multiply 7,000 ships a
11:31
year the number is astronomical making
11:34
us less competitive in the global
11:35
environment the river becomes less
11:37
viable to the ships that are being used
11:39
you're gonna have less of that tax
11:41
revenue because people are gonna make
11:43
their ships elsewhere right it's just a
11:45
downward spiral Slane was pumped to see
11:47
the administration tackled this downward
11:49
spiral until it became clear that his
11:51
list of infrastructure priorities was
11:53
not itself a priority when did you
11:55
realize that the administration was kind
11:57
of not taking her February of 2017 my
12:01
list was shelved at that point their
12:03
approach is to take most of the
12:05
infrastructure dump it back on to the
12:07
states and they know that the states
12:10
don't have the funding the states are
12:12
not gonna raise taxes and it's a way to
12:14
coheres the states into using
12:17
public-private partnerships
12:19
having Wall Street finance
12:21
infrastructure the conflict is Wall
12:24
Street wants the maximum return on
12:26
investment when you have an asset that
12:29
is the public good you want the minimum
12:32
return on investment so this is their
12:35
plan and it's going nowhere and nothing
12:37
will be built
12:38
unfortunately the Trump plan is you up
12:40
heard is a sham the president has said
12:43
he wants to spend two hundred billion
12:44
dollars I'm not quite sure where those
12:45
dollars are coming from not gonna be
12:47
part of this budget Kerry flimflamming
12:49
you can pay for roads and bridges just
12:51
out of thin air I could have started
12:54
with infrastructure I actually wanted to
12:56
save the easy one for the one down the
12:58
road so we'll be having that done pretty
13:00
quickly whether Trump intends to get to
13:02
infrastructure quickly or down the road
13:05
or if these words are somehow supposed
13:06
to mean the same thing not having done
13:08
it right out of the gate may have been a
13:10
big oopsie I tried to convince them to
13:15
come out of the box on January 20th to
13:17
do infrastructure in my opinion is a
13:19
single biggest mistake the president
13:22
made and I think if he had done that he
13:24
would have been invincible in November
13:27
we're gonna get this infrastructure
13:29
going 1.5 trillion dollar investment in
13:33
American infrastructure we probably have
13:36
to wait till after the election
13:39
you
13:49
you
