[Music]
00:13
everybody's talking at me
00:17
I don't care what saying
00:20
only their goals of my
00:25
[Music]
00:31
pious Thomas rush hour at Penn Station
00:35
New York's busiest and at least aesthetically appealing railway Center
00:38
and trains I take pass through here
00:40
along the trains of half a million
00:42
others everyday which is connected to
00:45
New York and rest of the Northeast by
00:46
one little tunnel built in 1910 and
00:50
drastic need of repair

just like the
00:53
rest of America
structure one Amtrak's North River tunnel has two
01:00
tracks the only rail lines under the
01:02
Hudson connecting New York City to the
01:03
rest of the country
this bottleneck
01:05
that's even worse at winter when ice
01:07
forms in cracks left by Hurricane sandy
01:08
and

100 years of general wear and tear
01:11
forcing Amtrak to periodically shut down
01:13
the tunnels and defrost their catenary
01:14
electrical lines
01:18

when as you look around a wire usually
01:21
this bicycles which we say if we stop
01:23
them do not get that
01:30
this icicle here could trip out the
01:32
catenary to knock the wire down and
01:35
train to come in then you have 600
01:37
people here straighter and you got no
01:38
power people freeze it on a trade route
01:40
we keep up with the ice so what would
01:42
happen if we don't it'll happen a lot
01:57
what happens call the PD right now hey
02:02
did you lose the South tube now okay
02:04
we're almost done in here blot ice ice
02:09
scraping and other emergency maintenance
02:10
keeps the North River tunnel in service
02:12
at least for now

but it's a band-aid
solution to the complete overhaul the
tunnel needs to make it through its
second century intact

this thing needs
02:19
to be rebuilt essentially from the
02:21
inside out

so the idea here is to build
a new tunnel shift all the traffic into
the new tunnel

so that we can then come
02:27
back and rebuild these

so that would all
set down you have four tracks under the
Hudson

a four track Hudson rail line is
02:33
one of the goals of the Gateway program
02:35
while the new tunnel is still waiting
02:36
for full funding the old one puts as
02:38
much as 20% of the entire country's GDP
02:41
in jeopardy every time it has to be
02:42
closed which is frequently chaos and
02:45
confusion at Penn Station last night
02:47
brands and problems at Penn Station
02:49
again the North River tunnel needs
02:51
federal money to help cover its
02:52
estimated thirteen billion dollar price
02:54
tag a number that goes up by over 1
02:55
million dollars every day they put off
02:57
digging fortunately the guy we elected
02:59
president made a big deal out of
03:01
allocating big money to big
03:02
infrastructure projects just like this
03:04
one we need to pass a 1 trillion dollar
03:07
infrastructure plan to build new roads
03:11
and bridges and airports and tunnels and
03:13
highways and railways all across our
03:16
great nation turning that big promise
03:18
into an actual plan was delegated to
03:20
businessman and former member of the
03:21
us-china congressional Commission Dan
03:23
slain slain produced a list of 50
03:26
infrastructure projects for the Trump
03:27
transition team to consider prioritized
03:29
by their urgency and national importance
03:31
my plan was to search out the most
03:34
critical projects that we could start
03:36
with then define how many jobs would be
03:39
created by those what the economic
03:41
development benefit was so that I could
03:44
go up to Congress give them the
03:46
estimates and then the following year go
03:48
back and give them the actual numbers
03:50
that was the plan why did the approach
03:52
you for infrastructure plan because I
03:54
knew a lot about China I study what
03:57
China did when their economy would start
04:00
to dip they switched over to
04:02
structured they started building
04:03
railroads hospitals power stations all
04:06
over Eastern China billions of dollars
04:09
that they poured into their country and
04:11
then when the economy picked up again
04:13
they stopped and I saw the power of of
04:16
infrastructure our economy for the last
04:19
ten years has been stagnating there's
04:21
only two ways to grow your economy you
04:24
increase employment or your increased
04:26
productivity infrastructure does both
04:28
unlike China however the United States
04:30
hasn't tapped into the full economy
04:32
saving power of infrastructure since the
04:34
middle of the last century both in terms
04:36
of building new stuff and keeping the
04:37
old stuff in working order and it shows
04:41
now we just suspected this bridge last
04:44
year there you can see the extent of the
04:47
deterioration see the hole that's the
04:49
call to floor beam at actually is a
04:50
fracture critical member fracture
04:52
critical means and if one member fails
04:54
the bridge can fail okay there's a hole
04:57
on these you know very much ever floor
04:59
beam all the way through here's the
05:00
dates on these nuts just when they were
05:01
noticed or that's how we keep track of
05:03
it every time when we come back the next
05:05
time we look at that writing and decide
05:06
whether or not that hole has actually
05:08
grown or not and it has this bridge
05:10
undergone any like nature innovations
05:12
this thing was built nineteen forty
05:14
something
05:14
everything is done this bridge from now
05:16
on will be a band-aid it's a nice kind
05:17
of like throwing money into a car yeah
05:19
exactly
05:20
throwing money into a twenty year old
05:22
car the National Bridge inventory has a
05:25
zero to nine scale and this bridge is
05:27
rated to four which puts it in deficient
05:29
category we will close it when it gets
05:31
lower than a three
05:33
they were to lower the weight limit or
05:35
close the bridge where would be the
05:37
nearest crossing it's the only one but
05:39
then a hundred miles or so either
05:40
direction how much time would that add
05:42
to a trip I'm guessing probably four
05:43
hours to their time multiply those four
05:46
hours by just the six trucks we've seen
05:47
crossing the bridge in the 20 minutes
05:49
we've been here and you've already got
05:50
one full 24 hour day worth a lost time
05:52
and wasted gas then multiply that by the
05:55
rest of the trucks on this route every
05:56
day and multiply that by the number of
05:58
bridges and similar shapes statewide and
06:00
finally multiply all that by 50 states
06:02
and 365 days a year
06:04
and you see how the American trucking
06:05
industry claims to lose some 60 billion
06:07
dollars annually just allows the
06:09
infrastructure but a big old chunk of
06:11
American shipping is still done by
06:12
exactly that shipping though its initial
06:15
engineering was done by Mother Nature
06:16
the man-made infrastructure on our
06:18
country's waterways this is old and
06:19
dilapidated as it's terrestrial
06:21
counterparts the Army Corps of Engineers
06:23
operates a network of locks and dams
06:25
that allow cargo boats barges and
06:27
pleasure craft alike to navigate the
06:28
country's rivers both upstream and
06:30
downstream from one elevation to another
06:31
this is Locks and Dam 52 on the Ohio
06:35
River
06:35
this is America's single busiest lot
06:38
it's coming up on its 90th birthday
06:39
that's very old and things do break and
06:42
closures do happen when they do with it
06:44
costs our economy some billion dollars
06:46
every year I went to this jobs was kind
06:50
of like waiting around on something to
06:51
happen I don't know some I was waiting
06:53
it's the army it's hurry up a way but
06:55
the river dictates his job
06:58
we arrived at Locsin damn 52 smack in
07:01
the middle of another closure which by
07:02
this point has become routine a leak in
07:04
the busiest lock and dam on the Ohio
07:06
River and once again river traffic is at
07:09
a halt at 52 now usually the water would
07:12
be up to the top of the wicket when we
07:13
get it all the way closed off but last
07:16
night we're trying to raise the dam all
07:17
the way to the pier we got a hold of a
07:19
wicket and it came up sideways we let go
07:21
of it washed over a couple other wickets
07:23
and went down river so we lost that one
07:24
so we're gonna regroup we don't know
07:26
exactly what shape it's in until we dive
07:28
on it and pull them out it's 1927 dams
07:31
so at any time we can have a
07:32
catastrophic failure we're just gonna
07:33
cost more money it's a budget nightmare
07:36
I'm sure kind of falling apart but the
07:38
whole point of locks and dams system is
07:40
to prevent the river water from becoming
07:41
too shallow for a boat to pass through
07:43
it while many of the 100-year old parts
07:45
still work fine like this vintage jazz
07:47
era steam engine the parts that don't
07:52
can cause some serious headaches not
07:54
just for the lock tenders but for all
07:56
the boats upriver all those are those
07:59
tow boats damn how we use them a lot
08:02
for several miles as normal yes not once
08:06
bad traffic way it was
08:08
50 wait I hope they've got some good
08:11
books closures the 52 have last as long
08:13
as 18 days and the consequent boat jams
08:16
aren't just irritating they're also
08:17
expensive even having one boat wait here
08:19
for 15 hours has been estimated to cost
08:21
its company $80,000 we just have a lot
08:24
of traffic here but this is busiest lock
08:26
in the United States it's busier than a
08:28
Panama Canal everything's coming through
08:29
here this is America's economy log 52 is
08:33
supposed to be replaced with the state
08:34
of the art dam back in the 90s but it's
08:36
still under construction and this is
08:38
just one out of a whole network of locks
08:40
and dams on one River the Army Corps of
08:41
Engineers estimates that it needs a
08:43
minimum of five billion dollars worth of
08:45
repairs to keep the entire Inland
08:46
Waterways system navigable over the next
08:48
20 years
08:49
and for corn farmers like Paul Jesse and
08:51
the rest of our agricultural heartland
08:53
slash breadbasket there isn't really an
08:55
alternative these elevators are it's
08:57
right in the best place you can possibly
08:59
beeps have the cheapest transportation
09:01
for export that is why we're so
09:03
incredibly worried about the locks and
09:05
dams going down who absorbs the cost of
09:07
that that either has to be paid for by
09:10
us getting a lower price for our grain
09:12
for paying more for the other inputs
09:14
that we buy the only source of that
09:16
money in my opinion ultimately is
09:18
Department
09:22
even when the waterways older
09:23
infrastructure is working the scale at
09:25
wood shipping technology and output have
09:27
grown in the last hundred years this far
09:28
outstripped some of its capabilities
09:30
robots pass through lock 21 with a tow
09:33
boat pushing 150 foot barges these young
09:36
men I'll do is break off nine from the
09:38
15 push those through and then the boat
09:40
will push the other six turn rejoin
09:42
until the next log most of the United
09:46
States locks and dams aren't big enough
09:47
for a larger barge toes to pass through
09:49
all together so they have to be split up
09:51
and reassembled at every lock along
09:53
their route so now the bus and a lock
09:55
the deckhands are going to break apart
09:57
the two sections of barge I don't
10:00
guising how low-tech it is the guy on
10:02
top of the line it's called a mule
10:03
because that job used to be done by
10:05
mules no disrespect but I just felt like
10:08
they could give them a better title at
10:10
this point a slow going as the waterways
10:12
can get there still far and away the
10:13
most efficient and really the only
10:15
sustainable way of shipping cargo at
10:17
this scale if this were all to be
10:18
shipped by a train or trucks how many of
10:20
us take with a 15 barge tonne loaded at
10:23
nine foot it had to be 225 jumbo hopper
10:26
cars on a train it's 870 semi trucks
10:29
oh it's that'd be 11 and a half miles
10:30
bumper to bumper to move what's in these
10:33
barges that's crazy
10:34
once the barges make it through all the
10:36
locks and dams to the bottom of the
10:38
river they still have one more piece of
10:39
faulty infrastructure to contend with
10:41
before their goods can be shipped abroad
10:42
the port of South Louisiana also on
10:45
dance lands infrastructural fix-it list
10:47
[Music]
10:48
this is the major export port for the
10:51
United States when you think about 31
10:53
States most of them are shipping grain
10:55
and agriculture down here it was
10:57
unbelievable it's also pretty nice and
10:59
France to sell it to us for so cheap
11:00
right what's going on down here
11:04
the major problem here is the silting at
11:08
the mouth
11:09
a place called Southwest Bears and the
11:12
Corps doesn't have the resources to keep
11:15
it open to a level of 50 feet draught
11:18
that's the new ships coming through the
11:19
Panama Canal so 2016 they have to lower
11:22
the draft to 41 feet for every foot you
11:25
lower you lose a million dollars of
11:27
bargain when you multiply 7,000 ships a
11:31
year the number is astronomical making
11:34
us less competitive in the global
11:35
environment the river becomes less
11:37
viable to the ships that are being used
11:39
you're gonna have less of that tax
11:41
revenue because people are gonna make
11:43
their ships elsewhere right it's just a
11:45
downward spiral Slane was pumped to see
11:47
the administration tackled this downward
11:49
spiral until it became clear that his
11:51
list of infrastructure priorities was
11:53
not itself a priority when did you
11:55
realize that the administration was kind
11:57
of not taking her February of 2017 my
12:01
list was shelved at that point their
12:03
approach is to take most of the
12:05
infrastructure dump it back on to the
12:07
states and they know that the states
12:10
don't have the funding the states are
12:12
not gonna raise taxes and it's a way to
12:14
coheres the states into using
12:17
public-private partnerships
12:19
having Wall Street finance
12:21
infrastructure the conflict is Wall
12:24
Street wants the maximum return on
12:26
investment when you have an asset that
12:29
is the public good you want the minimum
12:32
return on investment so this is their
12:35
plan and it's going nowhere and nothing
12:37
will be built
12:38
unfortunately the Trump plan is you up
12:40
heard is a sham the president has said
12:43
he wants to spend two hundred billion
12:44
dollars I'm not quite sure where those
12:45
dollars are coming from not gonna be
12:47
part of this budget Kerry flimflamming
12:49
you can pay for roads and bridges just
12:51
out of thin air I could have started
12:54
with infrastructure I actually wanted to
12:56
save the easy one for the one down the
12:58
road so we'll be having that done pretty
13:00
quickly whether Trump intends to get to
13:02
infrastructure quickly or down the road
13:05
or if these words are somehow supposed
13:06
to mean the same thing not having done
13:08
it right out of the gate may have been a
13:10
big oopsie I tried to convince them to
13:15
come out of the box on January 20th to
13:17
do infrastructure in my opinion is a
13:19
single biggest mistake the president
13:22
made and I think if he had done that he
13:24
would have been invincible in November
13:27
we're gonna get this infrastructure
13:29
going 1.5 trillion dollar investment in
13:33
American infrastructure we probably have
13:36
to wait till after the election
13:39
you
13:49
you
