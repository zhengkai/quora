from the shores of the nile to the jungles of veitnam
从尼罗河的海岸到越南的丛林

lives a species that has conquered the myriad of terrain in this 8,000 kilometer stretch
在这 8000 公里范围内，生活着一个征服了各种地势的物种

this is one of the most widespread cats that you've probably never heard of the swamp cat
这是分布最广泛的一种猫之一，你可能从未听说过的沼泽猫

the swamp can also known as the jungle cat reed cat
沼泽猫也称作森林猫、芦苇猫

or incorrectly the swamp lynx
或者被错误的叫做沼泽猞猁

It's the feline equivalent of a jackal
就好像猫科版的狐狼

an animal that can survive in a variety of habitats
这种动物可以在各种息地中生存

and subsist on a variety of diets
以各种食物度日

this all-terrain feline has adapted to life in an incredible variety of habitats
这种全地形猫科动物能适应的环境多到难以置信

savanna grassland desert wetland and forest
热带草原、牧场、沙漠、湿地和森林

found all the way from the pyramids in Egypt past Angkor Wat
从埃及金字塔到吴哥窟的整个路径上都有存在

these cats have conquered more distance than Genghis Khan
这些猫咪征服的距离比成吉思汗还远

swamp cats are defined by their adaptability
沼泽猫以它们的适应性而得名

despite their ability to thrive in a variety of environments
尽管它们有能力在各种环境里繁衍

they are best suited for life in the wetlands like swamps and reeds
最适合的还是在遍布沼泽和芦苇的湿地中生活

towards the mediterranean, they are primarily found in wetlands while in Central Asia
从地中海出发，他们主要在中东的湿地被发现。

they're most often found in river valleys
他们最常见的是在河谷被发现

while their populations are relatively healthy in the foothills of the Himalayas
在喜马拉雅的山麓地区，他们的数量相对健康

they don't terribly well in cold weather and have a warm weather coat thus limiting their range to the north
它们不太喜欢寒冷的天气。适用于温暖气候的皮毛限制了它们在北方的范围

despite one of their names being the jungle cat
尽管它们还有个名字叫丛林猫

that they don't do particulary well in is their namesake the jungle
但他们并不能非常良好的适应森林

high canopy forests like rainforests don't have as many small plants on the ground for the caps to hide in leaving them vulnerable to predators
类似雨林这类高大树冠的森林里，地面没有足够多的矮小植物，能让他们躲避掠食者的危险

lack of hidding places
缺乏隐蔽的空间

in the wetlands however the abundance of low vegetation keeps them much safer
在湿地中，丰富的低矮植被让他们更安全

even though they thrive in multiple habitats the wetlands are what they are built for
尽管他们能在各种环境里繁衍，但是湿地才是它们的归宿

they have long graceful legs which allow them to walk through flooeded terrain with ease
它们有着优雅的长腿，让他们可以轻松穿越被水浸泡的地势

their coats are reddish beige with dark stripes along their tail to help them camouflage
他们的毛皮是偏红的米色，尾巴上有深色的条纹，这些能帮助他们在茂盛的叶子中伪装

swamp cats also have long tufted ears which help them camouflage by breaking up their outline while hidding in vegetation
沼泽猫的耳朵有着长长的毛簇，隐藏在植被后面时可以打破轮廓、帮助他们伪装

these tufts also make them resemble another feel it the Lynx
这些毛簇让他们看起来像另外一种猞猁

yet despite barriers they're much more closely ralated to the black-footed cat
尽管存在生殖隔离，但它们和黑足猫的亲缘关系非常近

and you guessed it the domestic cat and they share a diet with their cousins too
你也可以猜到家猫也是。他们之间的食谱也非常接近

though theirs is much broader their diet varies by region
尽管他们的更多样化，这取决于领地

but it's generally made up of rodents and small animals weighing under a kilogram
通常它们会吃啮齿类和体重低于一公斤的小动物

like young hogs, baby gazelles ducks and chattles
例如野猪和

one of the reasons that swamp cats are able to thrive in such a differing territories
沼泽猫在不同的领地都能繁衍的原因之一

is their ability to eat a wide variety of food including veggies
就是他们的食谱非常广泛，甚至包括蔬菜

in some areas including as Becca Stan about 15 percent of theirs diet is made up of olives
在乌兹别克斯坦等地，他们的食物里有 15% 是橄榄

but this cat has arise on something tastier than an olive

？？？

like domestic cats, swamp cats are ambush hunters
和家猫一样，沼泽猫是擅长伏击的猎手

she slowly approaches her prey

she needs to get as close as possible before striking
在下手前他会尽可能的接近猎物

stealth is her friends, if her pounce fails she will have to go the pursuit
潜行是他的朋友，如果突袭失败他会继续追捕
