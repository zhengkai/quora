hunting primarily at dusk and dawn she'll spend the rest of her day basking in the sun
打猎主要集中在黄昏和黎明，它把其它的时间用来晒太阳

util it's cooled down and she's ready to go back out on the prowl
直到天凉了下来，它也准备好去觅食了

like most cats the swamp cat is a solitary species
跟大多数猫科一样，沼泽猫是一种独居动物

and the only time they'll be seen together is when it's time to mate
