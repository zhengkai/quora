1. “I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion. The famine was their own fault for breeding like rabbits.”    
“我恨印度人。那是一些牲畜一般的人，信仰着牲畜一般的宗教。饥荒是他们自己造成的，因为他们像兔子一样繁殖。”

-Winston Churchill    
——温斯顿·丘吉尔

These are the exact words uttered by “Sir” Winston Churchill when he was requested to lighten the tax burdens atleast during the worst famine India has ever seen. And he called Indians, the people who let vultures like him enter their land, beasts. I still do not get the hypocrisy of this world where Hitler is a fascist while Churchill is a hero.    
这些话确实是“爵士”温斯顿·丘吉尔亲口说的。在印度出现有史以来最严重的饥荒后，丘吉尔被请求减轻赋税。而他说这些印度人——这些让像他这样的秃鹰进入他们领土的人——是牲畜。对于这个希特勒被称为法西斯份子而丘吉尔被称之为英雄的世界，我还是不想虚伪。

Jews killed in Concentration camps ~ 7 million    
集中营里被杀死的犹太人：7百万人

Number of Indians died in just one Bengal famine ~ 3 million    
仅一次孟加拉大饥荒就杀死的印度人：3百万人

You can do the math for the damage done to the economy and well being of the Indian subcontinent. British need not pay any reparations for such a demonic holocaust and many other loots but its not late to realize that Churchill was a cold blooded murderer… not a knight. He is no lesser an evil than Hitler himself.    
你可以计算这事件对印度次大陆的经济和民生造成了多大伤害。英国人不需要对这场恶魔般的大屠杀和许多其他的掠夺行为做赔偿，但是现在意识到丘吉尔是个冷血杀手——而不是名骑士——为时不晚。相比希特勒，他并不缺乏邪恶。

2. Few days turned these twins into Sworn Enemies. I am talking about the India-Pakistan Partition in 1947. Estimated death toll was marked to be around 1–2 million Hindus and Muslims migrating to and from India from the total migrated crowd of 14 million people. A never ending vengeance has erupted as an aftermath of this world’s bloodiest genocidal partition.    
几天之内，这些同胞就变成了不共戴天的敌人。我说的是 1947 年[印巴分治](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%B0%E5%B7%B4%E5%88%86%E6%B2%BB)。据估算，一百万到两百万印度教徒和穆斯林教徒死亡，共有一千四百万人迁回印度。在世界上最血腥的种族灭绝分裂之后，是永无休止的复仇不断爆发。
