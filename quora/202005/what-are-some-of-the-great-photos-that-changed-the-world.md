1. “I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion. The famine was their own fault for breeding like rabbits.”

-Winston Churchill

These are the exact words uttered by “Sir” Winston Churchill when he was requested to lighten the tax burdens atleast during the worst famine India has ever seen. And he called Indians, the people who let vultures like him enter their land, beasts. I still do not get the hypocrisy of this world where Hitler is a fascist while Churchill is a hero.

Jews killed in Concentration camps ~ 7 million

Number of Indians died in just one Bengal famine ~ 3 million

You can do the math for the damage done to the economy and well being of the Indian subcontinent. British need not pay any reparations for such a demonic holocaust and many other loots but its not late to realize that Churchill was a cold blooded murderer… not a knight. He is no lesser an evil than Hitler himself.

2. Few days turned these twins into Sworn Enemies. I am talking about the India-Pakistan Partition in 1947. Estimated death toll was marked to be around 1–2 million Hindus and Muslims migrating to and from India from the total migrated crowd of 14 million people. A never ending vengeance has erupted as an aftermath of this world’s bloodiest genocidal partition.
