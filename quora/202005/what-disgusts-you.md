When I first saw this on Instagram, I was absolutely furious. It’s a class photo of high schoolers. For goodness sake, it’s 2020 and shit like this still goes on in the world?

What made them think that wearing stereotypical “Asian” clothing and pulling at their eyes to make them look slanted wasn’t racist at all and perfectly acceptable for a school photo? Ignorance?

It shows the stereotypical way some people view east Asians as, and I’m just so disappointed that this much racism still exists today.

The school told The Independent (UK) this and I’m still angry.

“The picture was made during the '100 days celebration' of last Friday 6 March, an event in which last graders celebrate the end of their secondary education in a carnivalesque way. They choose an outfit long beforehand, in this case even long before there was any mention of the coronavirus.

”The students alluded to the recent events in a playful way by adding a sign. Neither the school team, nor the students involved, have ever had the intention of adopting a condescending or offensive attitude.

Nonetheless, the school would like to express its apologies publicly and explicitly through this statement," it added. "We did not estimate the consequences of publishing this picture correctly and we regret having offended certain population groups by it."

What? If this was supposed to be like an apology or whatever I’m still not happy.

“Traditional Chinese clothing” Excuse me but since when are panda costumes and kimonos and those hats considered CHINESE TRADITIONAL CLOTHING!?

They said they chose the costumes long before the COVID-19 outbreak, implying that it wouldn’t be wrong if they didn’t have the sign. Seems like they even have racist teachers. Wow.

I’m sick of people using the pandemic as an excuse to be racist (no pun intended).

Luckily I live in Japan, so I haven’t experienced any discrimination.

I’m so happy they got exposed and went viral, we really need to spread awareness about this.

This goes completely off-topic, but K-pop groups (especially popular ones such as BTS) faces so much prejudice it’s actually surprising.

Sorry for ranting and writing such a disorganized answer, kinda messed up welp :’/

Edit; I saw some disagreement in the comments and just to clarify we are in 2020 not the Victorian times.

There is a line between being offensive and being playful. I don’t think that brushing this off just because they’re teenagers is okay.

Edit 2; In the link to this site below there’s an Instagram post that leads the account which I found was some sort of anti-racist thing. It said that apparently the school had a lot of racist students and known for being troublesome. Not saying it’s true, just what I read, so check it out if you’re interested.

Edit 3; I keep getting comments about how it’s “just a joke” and they didn’t mean to offend anyone. Excuse me!? THERE IS A LINE BETWEEN JOKING AROUND AND BEING RACIST. Even if they didn’t mean to offend anyone, it’s still mocking a culture. By saying it’s a joke you’re saying it’s perfectly acceptable to be holding up a “Corona time” sign in stereotypical “Asian costumes”. Some of you guys’ attitudes are seriously pissing me off.

Edit 4; I’m disabling the comments - people said some things that I’ve now deleted. Kind of offended hehe :’(
